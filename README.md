# Introduction

  It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize frauds on credit card transactions.
  
   On Kaggle, we have access to a dataset which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by europeans. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
   
   The features V1, V2, ..., V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA and all are numeric and confidentials.

# Problem Statement


Due to the fraudulent credit card transactions problem, how good we can predict them?

To solve this problem, we'll follow a standard data science pipeline plan of attack:

#### 1. __Understand the problem and the data__
#### 2. Data exploration / data cleaning
#### 3. Feature engineering / feature selection
#### 4. Model evaluation and selection
#### 5. Model optimization
#### 6. Interpretation of results and predictions
